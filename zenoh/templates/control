Description: Eclipse Zenoh
 zenoh unifies data in motion, data in-use, data at rest and computations.
 It carefully blends traditional pub/sub with geo-distributed storages, queries and computations,
 while retaining a level of time and space efficiency that is well beyond any of the mainstream stacks.
